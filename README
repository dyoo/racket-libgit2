WARNING WARNING WARNING

Do not use this package yet.  I'm really using this to train myself on
the Racket FFI.  As such, I'll be doing some silly stuff here.  I'm
hoping that I can learn enough to turn this into a full-on tutorial on
the Racket FFI (and get a useful package in the process).  But for the
moment, everything here is not going to work well.

Especially copying the libgit2.so.0.  That's just wrong, but it makes
my exercising of the package a lot easier.
